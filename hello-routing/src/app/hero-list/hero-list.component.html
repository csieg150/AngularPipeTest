        <!--Data binding: where we project values from the TS file
        component onto an HTML view. There are many forms
        of data binding.
            
        First form: Double curly brace {{}} - interpolation. Evaluates
        an expression inside so you can do simple operations. Such as
        {{5+10}} = 15, or you can refer to variables in the TS component
        file. Doing this is known as One Way Databinding. No changes
        on the HTML page will reflect on the TS page.-->

            Below is a Structural Directive, and it can alter the entire structure of the HTML elements and DOM
